EdgenuityAuto - no config panel: automatically skips videos on Edgenuity and sends notifications when a quiz pops up.  
EdgenTweaks - ctrl+shift+H: I think maybe autoadvance works, random guess button works (only use for ungraded things), able to click during audio.  
Edgenuity-Skipper - shift+\: Possibly useless, supposedly autoplays videos, skips intro, hint, and exit audio, and reveals all hidden question parts.  
Edgenuity Addons - no config panel: Forces iframe to the next frame but doesn't actually mark it complete most of the time.

Just too much junk added into it that doesn't work, particularly the auto-answer thing
